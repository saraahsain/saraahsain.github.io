My name is Sara Ahsain and my portfolio is a representation of all what I have learned and accomplished throughout my experience as a Software Engineer.
In this portfolio you will find a mix of professional projects, personal projects as well as small applications made by me.
You will also find a section related to my diplomas, certifications and badges that I have earned up until now.
I would describe myself as lifelong learner with a main goal of improving the quality of my products and learn new concepts continuously.
